This is my First Single Page React App that is built using React Hooks and Context API. It also features an overlay effect. This is a simple food ordering page where users can add and delete meals from their cart, whenever a meal is added to the cart, the cart gets updated and reflects the current total amount one has to pay if he/she continues. However the order button does nothing as of now, since this web page is built only for learning purpose.

All the code for this project is available in the 'src.zip' folder

This webpage is hosted online via the heroku platform.

You can access this project via the link given below: food-ordering-app-v1.herokuapp.com
